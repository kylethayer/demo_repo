```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Here's some **Markdown**

```{r echo = FALSE}
#Here's some R code
print("hello world!")
```

```{r}
x <-runif(1:100)
hist(x)
```

```{r}
example_num <- 57
```

As a demo, I can display the example number, which is `r example_num`. See, isn't that cool?
